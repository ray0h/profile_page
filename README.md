# Profile Page

My name is Raymond Oh.  I am a Ceramics / Materials Engineer who has previously worked in manufacturing R&D roles.  During Covid, I fell in love with Javascript, Ruby and other fundamental web technologies and now seek to use my analytical problem solving experience for software development, ideally in roles having a social or environmental impact.

This is my portfolio page highlighting my skill stack and several projects.  It was made using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/).
