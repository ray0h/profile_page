# Profile Page

My name is Raymond Oh.  I am a Ceramics / Materials Engineer who has previously worked in R&D roles at several manufacturing plants.  Throughout Covid, I've been learning and falling in love with Javascript and other technology related to modern software development.  I am looking for an opportunity to apply my previous analytical experiences into a software developer role. 

This is my portfolio page highlighting my skill stack and several projects.  It was made using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/).
